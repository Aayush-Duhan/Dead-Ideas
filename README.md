# Dead-Ideas

Ideas that were halfway implemented but never ended up seeing through completion put here for others to pick and work on

## How to contribute an idea

1. Create a markdown file titled `<idea>.md` inside the folder `ideas/`
2. All files should be formatted in the following manner 

```md 
# <Idea title>

a short description on what the idea is 

## Why

talk about 
    - the problems that you saw causing you to come up with this idea to solve it 
    - something unique which you see isn't currently already implemented
    - something which is already implemented made better according to you

## How 

talk about 
    - how you thought of implementing the idea
    note: try to be vague so as to leave room for interpretation

## Challenges Faced

talk about 
    - the challenges you faced while implementing the idea
    note: try to be vague so as to leave room for interpretation

## Good to have features

    note: try to be vague so as to leave room for interpretation

contributed by [you github name](your github link)
```
3. Once the file is created, open a PR titled `Idea: <your idea>`
4. In the PR description paste the contents of your `<idea>.md` file

## How to work on an idea

1. Make an issue, make sure it follows the following template
    - Title -> `Idea submission: <the idea title you are working on>`
    - Description ->
        - The title to your project (it doesn't have to be the same as the one given in the idea document)
        - A very small description on what you implemented 
        - Link the idea that you would be working on 
        - Link your GitHub id along with the ids of the people working on it

    - note: multiple people (different teams/individuals) can choose to pick the same idea to implement

2. Create a PR with the same title as your issue with all your code inside `implementations/`
3. Inside the PR mention
    - The linked issue that you opened 
    - What all new things you added
    - Deployment instructions (how to run it for testing)
    - Link the idea that you would be working on 
    - Link your GitHub id along with the ids of the people working on it
4. You are free to give the idea a better name, just make sure the folder is named the same as what you are going with

note: not all submitted ideas can be merged with the main branch, but just because your submission wasn't merged doesn't mean that it is bad
