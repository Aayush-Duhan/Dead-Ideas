# Time Vault

Time Vault is kind of a immutable statement ledger which stores statement of user which acts as proof of statment for that user. 

## Why

A Smart Contract on a Self-Hosted Blockchain

Imagine someone wants to prove they made a statement before taking a specific action.

The “action” here could be anything, such as:

Listing a stolen product on a marketplace
Taking a serious step in a personal or professional context (e.g., college students or employees making critical decisions).
For instance, suppose I make a statement about listing a stolen product on a marketplace with the intention of finding the rightful owner and returning it for free. When the real owner contacts me, I can use this timestamped statement as proof of my original intent—to return the product, not to sell it.

While this is a basic example, such a concept can be applied to more serious cases. A timestamped note can act as solid proof in situations where an individual is unavailable or their motives are questioned.

Social media can sometimes serve this purpose, but it lacks reliability. Since social platforms are privately owned, they can erase or alter content at any time, potentially within hours, making them untrustworthy for critical proof.

## How 

Best way to gain trust is using blockchain as its publicly available.

We can host our own public records to serve as proof of statements. This can be achieved using peer-to-peer connections, similar to blockchain architecture. Additionally, tools like IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) can be used to securely store associated files, ensuring both transparency and permanence.

## Challenges Faced

The biggest challenge in this system is verifying whether the person is legitimate. However, this issue is already resolved through the use of public and private keys, which ensure authenticity and ownership.

The 2nd challenge is establishing trust, but I believe this can be effectively addressed by maintaining public records of proof of statements. With transparency and immutability, trust becomes less of a hurdle.

## Good to have features
- A place to upload statments as a file.
- A public verifier for verification of proof of statments.
