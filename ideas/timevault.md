# Time Vault

Time Vault is kind of a immutable statement ledger which stores statement of user which acts as proof of statment for that user. 

## Why

IDK but it sounds very stupid simply a smart contract on self hosted blockchain.

Don't really know the actual use but what if someone wants to prove that they said a particular statement before doing something.

"Something" here can be anything like for example :
- Listing a stolen product on marketplace
- Taking some serious actions (yk college students or employees).

So here suppose i give a statment about listing a stolen product on marketplace to find the real owner and give him the product for free. so when the real owner finds me i can show this as a proof of that timestamp that i am supposed to do that not really sell the product.

This was very basic case but this might expand for serious cases. A time note can act as a solid proof in absence of an individual.

Soical media does the same work it can act as proof but as its privately owned i have no trust in them as they can take anything out of existence within few hours.

## How 

Best way to gain trust is using blockchain as its publicly available.

We can host our own public records of proof of statments using peer2peer connections almost similar to as blockchain and can also use something like IPFS to store files.


## Challenges Faced

The biggest problem in this is to prove weather the person is legit or not but its already solved by the help of public and private keys.

The 2nd problem is the trust & i think it will not be that hard with a public records of proof of statments.

## Good to have features
- A place to upload statments as a file.
- A public verifier for verification of proof of statments.
