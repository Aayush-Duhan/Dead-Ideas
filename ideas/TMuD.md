# The Music Database

A database for Music, Lyrics, Samples.

## Why

There is [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/),[TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/), [TVDb](https://www.thetvdb.com/) etc. for movies and shows. [IGDb](https://www.igdb.com/) for games. But nothing good for music. There are some APIs, but some are proprietary and some are incomplete.
- TMuD is an All-In-One Database for everything related to music: Lyrics, Samples, Beats etc. 
- Rating, Review and Ranking system like IMDb.
- Artist, Label, Album, Musicians related information.
- Awards and Nominations Data
- Discussion Forum/ Board

## How 

- Initially it can rely on some already existing incomplete databases like MusicBrainz, Genius, TheAudioDB etc to get the data for Songs, Labels, Albums. Later on it can be integrated with all major platforms to get data just as a song is being uploaded.
- It can scrape popular music awards' databases for Awards and Nomination data.
- Maybe something like Shazam, SoundHound for getting information about samples/ beats used. (Not really sure how and if it can implement something like this)
- A simple discussion forum with ability to mention any song, artists, album, label etc. Even sharing clips of songs to discuss about.


## Challenges Faced

- Getting the samples and beats data
- Incomplete / Insufficient data
- Legal Issues
- Large Dataset

## Good to have features

- Data for music videos (like cast, crew, budget etc.)
- Music Streaming
- Be Open Source and have a usable API for free (or maybe a very small fee?)
