# Task Flow:
A Decentralized Platform where a user posts tasks with the pay for it and others get matched to it on the basis of a ML matchmaking algo

## Why:
Most of the freelancers today struggle with getting that first client/job according to their current skillset and same with the client of finding the apt person for the job. 

This platform would bridge that gap between the client and the freelancer while also entrusting transparency being a decentralized platform

## How:
- The given task and the payout for it is tokenized as a smart contract then users can create their profile in the main website with all their skills mentioned
- We write an ML algo that matches the user's job requirement with that of the freelancers based on many metrics like idk, prior work, projects/github profile and performance

(You can maybe implement the algo in such a way that it analyzes the freelancer’s github profile and gives out a certain score out of 10 and do the same for all other specific job’s   metrics)  
then sum it up, the highest would get matched for the user’s job requirement)

- Finally handle the entire payments system via the blockchain for better transparency

## Challenges faced:
- Writing an ML algo that normalizes every given profile of the freelancer can be little tricky because of the various parameters used
- How do you verify the credibility of the user, like how would you know if the github profile they have provided is actually that freelancer's?
- There should be some minimum condition for the payout for a particular job and setting up all those conditions can be little challenging provided each user would expect different payout for different tasks

## Good to have features:
- One actual great feature could be how multiple users can like work on a single task and split the entire payout while getting paid through digital currency
- You can gamify the entire thing, being a decentralized platform you can add a certain game that while played by the user/freelancer get paid game coins which can be used to access certain features, we can promote maybe advertisements inside the game for extra revenue..
- You can try adding like a forum kinda thing inside the decentralized platform for the users to interact with the freelancer.. (This would again kinda neglect the whole part of the platform being Decentralized, so if you are implementing this try to add some unique feature along)
