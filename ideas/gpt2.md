# Idea

A gpt2 themed chatbot

## Why

   - First thing first the idea is real cool as a learning project to get started with LLMs in machine learning
   - Teaches basic yet very powerful concepts like attention mechanism and Transformers.
   - Flex in front of friends when they use chatbots without knowing how they work. 

## How 
  
  - There are already methods and videos to implement standard gpt 2 model but that's lame
  - Exploring what new open source LLMs like Gemma and Ollama uses and incorporating all that to get an even better model.
  - Referring to youtube videos about the same topic, then prompting different methods to apply the methods which are         used to implement set techniques in a chatbot.

## Challenges Faced

 - Biggest Challenge will be collecting data and data cleaning.
 - Trying not to copy code from internet without any learning something new ðŸ’€.

## Good to have features

 - Having RAG layer
 - A frontend to interact with the chatbot.
